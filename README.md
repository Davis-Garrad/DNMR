#DNMR

The *Data Analysis, Visualisation, and Interpretation Software for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance* (DAVISNMR, or more simply **DNMR**) is a piece of software including a GUI to read and analyse files generated by the frappy-Tecmag NMR interface described [here](www.psi.ch/en/lin/nmr-spectroscopy-0). Limited support for .TNT files natively generated by Tecmag's TNMR program.

Features:
- Quick comparison of completely separate datasets (parallel viewing and handling)
- Equally quick loading and combination of separate-but-related datasets for analysis (live concatenation of datasets) 
- Auto or manual data re-phasing, both for individual data points or in bulk
- View time-domain and frequency-domain data
- Apply easily-customisable filters to time-domain data
- Common NMR analysis workflows including T1 fitting, field scans, and inverse Laplace transforms (ILTs)
- Export processed data into an easy-to-handle CSV format
- Easily extensible framework for custom analyses
